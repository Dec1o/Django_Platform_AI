# Django_Platform_AI - Documentation:

## Project Overview üöÄ
**Django_Platform_AI** is a web application developed with the Django framework, which integrates artificial intelligence features to improve user interaction.

## Technologies Used üõ†Ô∏è
- **Django**: Web framework for backend development.
- **PostgreSQL**: Relational database used in the application.
- **Django Rest Framework (DRF)**: Implementation of REST APIs.
- **AWS S3**: Cloud file storage.
- **Selenium and Flask**: Used in integrations and automation.
- **LangChain and OpenAI**: Tools for natural language processing (NLP) and AI.

## Database & ORM üîó
Django's ORM is used to manage CRUD operations, maintaining data integrity and implementing relationships between entities. Queries are optimized to ensure efficiency, and the data model follows best practices for relational databases.

## Database Structure and Relationships üìä
Each application implements CRUD operations to manage its respective entities. Relationships in the database are established using Django models (`models.py`).

### Relationship Example
- **Users and Companies**: A user can be associated with one or more companies (Many-to-Many).
- **Files and Groups**: A file can belong to a specific group (One-to-Many).
- **Chats and Users**: Each chat interaction is linked to a user (Many-to-One).
